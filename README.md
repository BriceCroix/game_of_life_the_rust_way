# John Conway's Game Of Life, the Rust way

What is the purpose of this project ? Well this is my first and only (as I am writing this) Rust project.
John Conway's game of life is a fun way to learn a new langage, since there are many project out there to take inspiration from.

This project only has an educative purpose, and does not pretends to anything.
