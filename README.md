# John Conway's Game Of Life, the Rust way

What is the purpose of this project ? Well this is my first and only (as I am writing this) Rust project.
John Conway's game of life is a fun way to learn a new langage, since there are many project out there to take inspiration from.

This project only has an educative purpose, and does not pretends to anything. 

This whole repository can even be considered as a playground to test Rust and github features.
